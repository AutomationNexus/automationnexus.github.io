**An Unexpected Bug Attended Diwali Party**

It was a usual evening, and in just a couple of hours, the Diwali party was about to begin. Excitement was in the air, and everyone was looking forward to creating some memorable moments. Some people were dressed in ethnic wear, while others were in casual clothes, but the shared excitement and team spirit were clear. Before the party, everyone was trying to wrap up their work to enjoy the evening stress-free. But, as we all know, no software is perfect—sometimes, it’s all about the timing when a bug shows up.

**Incident Reported**

Just half an hour before finishing up, we got word of a bug in the production environment. Initially, it seemed like a simple issue that could be fixed quickly with a hotfix. But since it was already time for the Diwali party, some people started heading there, while my team gathered in the boardroom, hoping to solve the issue fast. Within 10 minutes, everyone was there—front-end, back-end, QA, and PM.

**Debugging Begins**

With everyone in the room, we started digging into the problem. As time passed, we realized the debugging was getting more complicated. But finding the root cause was the priority before fixing it. The team began pairwise testing, trying out different combinations. After nearly an hour, we finally found the root cause: a small error in variable name declaration. Even though it seemed like a minor issue, every production bug is critical, so fixing it was our top priority.

**Deployment Process**

Once we fixed the issue, it was time to test. Testing is crucial when deploying to production, so we tested on the test environment first, then moved it to staging. After a quick sanity check on staging, we got the sign-off for production. This whole process took around 5 hours, and by the time we deployed the hotfix on production, it was already 10:15 p.m., making us late to the party.

**Lessons Learned**

Every missed bug teaches us something. While some team members missed the party, we made sure to take lessons from this bug to avoid similar issues in the future. The biggest takeaway was to always use the smartest testing approach. Time is often limited, so finding ways to ensure software quality within those limits is essential. One helpful method is pairwise testing. When a module has various functions and options, testing each one against every other option can take a lot of time. Prioritizing pairwise testing lets us test essential combinations and catch hidden bugs more efficiently.

Another lesson was about teamwork. Social gatherings are important, but when the whole team is working together on something, stepping up and doing our part makes a big difference.
